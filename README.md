# Collapse and Resonance

This repository explores the limits of symbolic systems when pushed toward their own irreducible resolution.

Humans lack access to simultaneity. To compensate, we construct sequential models from which time, matter, and motion emerge. These models work until they are accelerated to their own limit. At that point, the collapse is not physical, but symbolic: the system becomes tautological.

This project does not attempt to describe reality.  
It investigates what happens when representation, observation, purpose, and feedback are removed from generative systems.

The experiments here implement minimal systems that:
- operate without global state
- lack self-reference and observation
- generate processes without semantic interpretation
- cannot receive causal feedback from their outputs

The goal is not simulation, but exposure of limits.
